👋 Hi, I’m Kristian

I'm a 2nd year University Student that recently dropped out of college because of financial problems. 

While contemplating on what to do I saw a Udemy ad while scrolling on youtube and I saw some interesting courses available there and I'm intrigued in Web Development field so I bought one while it's on sale.

I'm Currently Learning in Dr.Angela's Web Development Bootcamp as a first step of landing a job or to freelance to support my self.

My current Goal is to finish Dr.Angela's Web Development Bootcamp and hopefully it can help me land a job and become a Developer in the future.
